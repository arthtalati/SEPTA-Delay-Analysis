The SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) Regional Rail system consists of commuter rail service on 13 branches to more than 150 active stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and its suburbs and satellite cities.\n","\n","\n","SEPTA reports On-Time Performance (OTP) to measure service reliability. OTP identifies the number of trains for all rail lines that arrive at their scheduled destination at the scheduled time. However, by industry standard, a train may arrive up to 5 minutes and 59 seconds after its scheduled time and still be considered on-time. SEPTA has set an On-Time Performance target such that 91% of its trains arrive on time. Thus, even with 100% “on time” performance, trains may still arrive late, forcing commuters to deal with uncertainty and lost time – especially if they rely on back-to-back connections.\n","\n","Here is the [main dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/septa/on-time-performance)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LVgrX1MQHIBM","colab_type":"code","outputId":"61b9fa42-45a1-4e2c-d797-01e0d6f51c57","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588784894883,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":23206,"user":{"displayName":"Arth Talati","photoUrl":"","userId":"07662990729879237614"}}},"source":["# Mounting Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","path = '/content/gdrive/My Drive/545/Project_545'"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Go to this URL in a browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=947318989803-6bn6qk8qdgf4n4g3pfee6491hc0brc4i.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3aietf%3awg%3aoauth%3a2.0%3aoob&response_type=code&scope=email%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fdocs.test%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fdrive%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fdrive.photos.readonly%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fpeopleapi.readonly\n","\n","Enter your authorization code:\n","··········\n","Mounted at /content/gdrive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8BQALXibHKrW","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85},"outputId":"d67c7cec-a691-4488-f7d1-5750624e27f0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588784905065,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10178,"user":{"displayName":"Arth Talati","photoUrl":"","userId":"07662990729879237614"}}},"source":["!unzip '/content/gdrive/My Drive/545/Project_545/on-time-performance.zip' "],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Archive:  /content/gdrive/My Drive/545/Project_545/on-time-performance.zip\n","  inflating: database.sqlite         \n","  inflating: otp.csv                 \n","  inflating: trainView.csv           \n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"a_PrDpmqHyye","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":71},"outputId":"bfe59837-3896-4a3c-b319-9d494a697cff","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588784906550,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":11658,"user":{"displayName":"Arth Talati","photoUrl":"","userId":"07662990729879237614"}}},"source":["# IMPORTS\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import math\n","import sqlite3\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","import plotly.express as px\n","import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n","\n","from wordcloud import WordCloud\n","from wordcloud import STOPWORDS"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/statsmodels/tools/_testing.py:19: FutureWarning: pandas.util.testing is deprecated.
